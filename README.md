A Nintendo GameBoy emulator written in C.
I'm going to try and implement this emulator following
[*DMG-01: How to Emulate a Game Boy*](https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/)
by Ryan Levick. The tricky part is that this book uses Rust to implement the emulator,
but I want to use C, so things could go south quickly. We'll see how this turns out.
